# Search-Queries-Anomaly-Detection
Search Queries Anomaly Detection is a technique used to identify unusual or unexpected patterns in search query data. It helps businesses detect potential issues or opportunities, such as unexpectedly high or low Click-Through Rates (CTR). This project implements anomaly detection for search queries using statistical and machine learning approaches.

---
# Process
Data Collection: Gather historical search query data from sources like search engines or website search logs.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data distribution, query frequency, trends, and patterns.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful attributes that aid in anomaly detection.
Algorithm Selection: Choose an anomaly detection model, such as:
Statistical methods (e.g., Z-score analysis)
Machine learning techniques (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
Model Training: Train the selected model using the prepared data.
Anomaly Identification: Apply the trained model to detect outliers in search queries.

# Correlation Insights
Clicks & Impressions: Positively correlated (more impressions lead to more clicks).
Clicks & CTR: Weak positive correlation (slight increase in CTR with more clicks).
Clicks & Position: Weak negative correlation (higher ad/page positions may result in fewer clicks).
Impressions & CTR: Negatively correlated (higher impressions often result in lower CTR).
Impressions & Position: Positively correlated (higher positions receive more impressions).
CTR & Position: Strong negative correlation (higher positions result in lower CTR).

# Key Takeaways
Anomalies are not just outliers; they indicate areas for growth, optimization, and strategic focus.
Emerging trends in search queries can reflect shifts in user interest.
Continuous monitoring ensures website relevance and user engagement.
